# **Overview**

The Sge Network chain relies on external off-chain data of matches and other sport events. To push this data reliably to the chain, some kind of origin verification is required. The `DVM module` essentially fills this role in the Sge Network chain. The `DVM Module` verifies the following data:

- Event data pushed by the House to the chain
- Validity of Odds data during bet placement by user
