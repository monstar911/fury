```proto
// Msg defines the Msg service.
service Msg {

  // SettleBet defines a method to settle the given bet
  rpc SettleBet(MsgSettleBet) returns (MsgSettleBetResponse);

}
```

```proto
// MsgSettleBet defines a message to settle the given bet
message MsgSettleBet {
  // creator is the bettor address
  string creator = 1;

  // bet_uid is the unique uuid of the bet to settle
  string bet_uid = 2 [(gogoproto.customname) = "BetUID" ,(gogoproto.jsontag) = "bet_uid", json_name = "bet_uid"];

  // bettor_address is sthe bec32 address of the bettor
  string bettor_address = 3;
}

// MsgSettleBetResponse is the returning value in the response of MsgSettleBet request
message MsgSettleBetResponse {
    string error = 1;
    string bet_uid = 2 [(gogoproto.customname) = "BetUID" ,(gogoproto.jsontag) = "bet_uid", json_name = "bet_uid"];
}

```

### **Bet Settlement Failure cases**

The transaction will fail if:

- Basic validation fail:
  - Invalid creator address
  - Invalid bettor address
  - Empty bet UID
- Bet UID in invalid
- There is no matching bet for the bettor address
- Bet is canceled
- Bet is already settled
- Corresponding sport-event not found
- Result of corresponding sport-event is not declared
- There is an error in SR module functions

### **Settlement failure treatment**

- If corresponding sport-event is aborted or canceled, the bet will be updated in the module state as below:

    ```go
    bet.Result = types.Bet_RESULT_ABORTED
    bet.Status = types.Bet_STATUS_SETTLED
    ```

- Resolve the bet result based on the sport-event result, and update field `Result` to indicate won or lost, and field `Status` to indicate result is declared.
- Call `Order Book module` to unlock fund and payout user based on the bet's result, and update the bet's `Status` field to indicate it is settled.
- Store the updated bet in the module state.
